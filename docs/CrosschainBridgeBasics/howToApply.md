Applying for a Bridge Listing
-----------------------------

To apply for a token Bridge listing, a member of the project team needs to complete this form [Applying for a Multichain Token Bridge](https://dard6erxu8t.typeform.com/to/C7RwF08A).

Before completing this Listing Application form, the team should read this [How to Apply for Cross Chain Bridges](https://anyswap.medium.com/how-to-apply-for-cross-chain-bridges-on-anyswap-82fcb6c9f0d2).

We do require that project teams can reassure us that there will be sufficient liquidity on the chain that the token will be bridged to. This is to avoid the situation that a user bridges a token, but they are then unable to swap it and must bridge it back, for which they are charged.

Please note that Bridge listing is usually free for established projects that appear on [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en) and when they are prepared to wait for 2 weeks for Bridge listing.

If the bridge is to or from Ethereum however, we do need to prefund the smart contract with ETH gas and we seek payment of 2 ETH to do this.

For new projects that are not yet listed at Coingecko, we perform due diligence, which can take 2 or more weeks, depending on how quickly we can gather the information we need to do this. A new project can bypass this requirement by paying a 5 ETH fee.

It normally takes about 2 weeks for a new Bridge to go live. Occasionally a project may need a listing more quickly than this. If this is the case and to compensate us for the disruption to our work schedule, we charge a Rapid Listing fee of 2 ETH.


Applying for Inclusion in the Router
------------------------------------

Normally we insist that a project first applies for a Bridge listing before we will include them in the Router (See [How It Works](/HowItWorks/howItWorks.md) if you are not sure of the difference between a Bridge and the Router).

After a period of time when we are confident that a project's bridges are working well, we can upgrade the Bridges to the Router, so that users can transfer tokens between any two chains, without having to first return them to the chain that they were originally minted. Avoiding the additional step can save the user a lot of fees, especially if they had to bridge back to Ethereum.

Once a project's token is on the Router, the project team can simply ask us to add additional chains and we will do this quickly.

Occasionally for larger projects, we will make exceptions and implement their token directly to the Router.

X is a fully decentralized cross-chain swap protocol, which enables any blockchain that uses ECDSA or EdDSA as a signature algorithm access to cross-chain bridge solutions. X has deployed cross-chain bridges for more than 500 projects (hyperlink to new URL of anyswap.net) and has developed 18 popular chains (hyperlink to URL of anyswap.net) since its launch on the 20th July 2020. On June 4th 2021, X launched its multichain router V3 beta mainnet. Multichain router V3 has three significant features:

1. Non-custodial + MPC:

    Non-custodial services are what distiguishes it from a decentralized solution. It is considered a strong and powerful symbol of decentralization to have no reliance on any intermediaries. X does not ever posess any funds/assets owned by an individual, instead the whole operational process is conducted by trustless smart contracts and controlled by the X MPC Network.

2. Native Swap:

    Native swap makes it less complicated to cross-chain swap between native tokens. This can be achieved without wrapped tokens.

3. Multichain Router:

    This feature allows users to swap between two chains arbitrarily, which makes it easier and with a lower fee to accomplish.
